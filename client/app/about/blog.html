            Today is an exciting day. After nearly a year of hard work, we’re officially launching BODY -- a first-of-its kind fitness & wellness experience that brings high-end group fitness classes and personal coaching to users in real time -- wherever they have an internet connection -- at a price almost anyone can afford!
          </p>
          <p>
          We created BODY after being tired of having to choose between overpriced studios and home fitness solutions that bored us half to death and ultimately failed to produce results. We believe that in order for home fitness to be successful it has to be social and fun, with just the right amount of personalization.
          </p>
          <p>
          Until now, other home fitness solutions have been leaving users lonely in their living rooms streaming videos or trudging through unenthusiastic "group" experiences with lackluster audio/visual quality. Something had to change -- and it just has.
          </p>
          <p>
          We’re technologists so we come at this from a different angle than most fitness services. BODY’S  proprietary, tech-first approach gives users:
          </p>
             
          <p class = "mt0 mb0">&bull; A high-energy/high-end feel with plenty of motivation</p>
          <p class = "mt0 mb0">&bull; Personal instruction from elite coaches from around the country</p>
          <p class = "mt0 mb0">&bull; A small group feel with just 12 users per class</p>
          <p class = "mt0 mb0">&bull; Social features allowing you to share results and compete with friends</p>
          <p class = "mt0 mb0">&bull; A 24/7 coaching and wellness hotline for all of your fitness and nutrition needs</p>          

          <p class = "mt32">
          At only $30 a month,  we’re on a mission to offer the world’s most effective and convenient home fitness training that aligns with your busy schedules, but most importantly, your life.  
          
          </p>
          <p>
          Over the course of BODY’s development we worked with a lot of amazing people who were looking for ways to fit fitness into their lives. Some of those who had the most profound impact on us were new and single parents. With the weight of the world already on their shoulders, we wanted to find a way to give a little bit back to these Super Parents who sacrifice so much for their family on a daily basis.  
          </p>
          <p>
          We're excited to announce that in honor of National Single Parents Day on March 21st, we will be giving a coupon code to everyone who <a href = "/">signs up for BODY</a> from today through March 21st to refer a single  Super Parent for a 6 month free membership! It’s the least we can do.
          </p>
          <p>
          We truly appreciate your support and look forward to continuing to improve BODY in every way possible!
