              BODY was founded with a rebellious spirit and lofty objective: to offer you the world’s most effective group fitness training that’s both healthy and aligned with your values. Our classes are led by one or more of our one of a kind coaches who will instruct you how to move your body with proper mechanics, to become stronger and more flexible. To increase your endurance and stamina. To move with grace and agility.

              Each class is capped at 15 clients – thus providing the hands on coaching and attention that you deserve. It’s time for your home fitness to leave you happy and vibrant, leading you to the best version of yourself. Since our classes are live, you will find yourself with a new social and support network, which will help you on your continued path to greater health and happiness.
