		<h5 class="mb16">LAST UPDATED: February 2, 2016</h5>

		<p class="mb8">These Terms of Service (“Terms“) govern your use of the free services, software and websites (the “Service”) provided by BODY App, Inc. (“BODY”). Our <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a> explains the way we collect and use your information and our <a href="/acceptable_use">Acceptable Use Policy</a> outlines our expectations with respect to your behavior when using the Service. By using the Service you agree to be bound by these Terms, our Privacy Policy and our Acceptable Use Policy. If you’re using our Service on behalf of an organization or entity (“Organization”), then you are agreeing to these Terms on behalf of that Organization and you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind the Organization to these Terms. In that case, “you” and “your” refers to that Organization. If you become a paid member to BODY’s membership Service, then your use of the Service will be governed by our <a href="/membership_agreement">Membership Agreement</a>.</p>

		<h3 class="mt16 mb16">Your Likeness</h3>

		<p class="mb8">The service facilitates group fitness classes which share a video feed of you and your surroundings (together the "Likeness") with BODY instructors as well as your fellow classmates. We may record your Likeness to better provide you services. You control how and when your Likeness is recorded and with whom you choose to share it with via your settings on the Service.</p>

		<p class="mb8">We reserve the right to block your Likeness on the Service that violates our <a href="/acceptable_use">Acceptable Use Policy</a> or these Terms or that we otherwise reasonably believe may create liability for BODY.</p>

		<h3 class="mt16 mb16">Your Content</h3>

		<p class="mb8">The Service allows you to record results and post comments about your workouts (together the “Content”) and to share that Content with others. You retain ownership of your Content, but by uploading it onto the Service, you are granting us a license to use, copy, reproduce, process, adapt, publish, transmit, host and display that Content for the purpose of (i) providing you the Service and associated support; and (ii) analyzing and improving the operation of the Service.</p>

		<p class="mb8">We reserve the right to remove Content on the Service that violates our Acceptable Use Policy or these Terms or that we otherwise reasonably believe may create liability for BODY.</p>

		<h3 class="mt16 mb16">Your Obligations</h3>

		<ul>
			<li class="mb16">You must provide accurate information when you create your BODY account.</li>
			<li class="mb16">You are responsible for safeguarding the password and for all activities that occur under your account.</li>
			<li class="mb16">You should notify BODY immediately if you become aware of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account.</li>
			<li class="mb16">You must comply with our <a href="/acceptable_use">Acceptable Use Policy</a> at all times when using the Service.</li>
			<li class="mb16">You may never use another user’s account without permission.</li>
			<li class="mb16">You may not disassemble, decompile or reverse engineer the Service or attempt or assist anyone else to do so, unless such restriction is prohibited by law.</li>
			<li class="mb16">Our Service is not intended for use by persons under the age of 18. By using the Service you are representing to us that you are over the age of 18.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3 class="mt16 mb16">Your Use of BODY Software</h3>

		<p class="mb8">As part of the Service, we provide browser based software (the “Software”) for your use in connection with the Service. So long as you comply with these Terms, we grant you a limited, nonexclusive, nontransferable, revocable license to use the Software, solely to access the Service; provided, however, that this license does not constitute a sale of the Software or any copy thereof, and as between BODY and You, BODY retains all right, title and interest in the Software.</p>

		<h3 class="mt16 mb16">Your Use of Third Party Applications</h3>

		<p class="mb8">If you elect to utilize any third party application in connection with your use of the Service, by doing so you are consenting to your Content being shared with such third party application. To understand how such third party application provider utilizes your Content and other information, you should review their privacy policy.</p>

		<h3 class="mt16 mb16">Security</h3>

		<p class="mb8">We will use industry standard technical and organizational security measures in connection with the storage, processing and transfer of your Content that are designed to protect the integrity of that Content and to guard against unauthorized or unlawful access to, use of, or processing of such Content.</p>

		<h3 class="mt16 mb16">Termination</h3>

		<p class="mb8">You are free to stop using our Service at any time. We also reserve the right to suspend or end the Service at any time at our discretion and without notice. We may also terminate or suspend your access to the Service at any time if you are not complying with these Terms or our Acceptable Use Policy or if you are using the Service in a manner that we believe may cause us financial or legal liability.</p>

		<h3 class="mt16 mb16">BODY's Intellectual Property Rights</h3>

		<p class="mb8">The Service (excluding Content provided by users) constitutes BODY’s intellectual property and will remain the exclusive property of BODY and its licensors. Any feedback, comments, or suggestions you may provide regarding the Service is entirely voluntary and we will be free to use such feedback, comments or suggestions as we see fit and without any obligation to you.</p>

		<h3 class="mt16 mb16">Modifications of the Service</h3>

		<p class="mb8">The Service may be modified from time to time, often without prior notice to you. Your continued use of the Service constitutes your acceptance of such modifications. If you are not satisfied with a modification we make to the Service, your sole remedy is to terminate your use of the Service.</p>

		<h3 class="mt16 mb16">Indemnification</h3>

		<p class="mb8">You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless BODY and its licensee and licensors, and their employees, contractors, agents, officers and directors, from and against any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs or debt, and expenses (including but not limited to attorney’s fees) arising from your use of and access to the Service or the Software, or from or in connection with any Content uploaded to the Service through your account by a third party using your account with your knowledge or consent.</p>

		<h3 class="mt16 mb16">No Warranty</h3>

		<p class="mb8">THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT. BODY IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY THIRD PARTY CONTENT THAT YOU DOWNLOAD OR OTHERWISE OBTAIN THROUGH THE USE OF THE SERVICE OR FOR ANY DAMAGE OR LOSS OF DATA THAT MAY RESULT. WE DO NOT WARRANT, ENDORSE, GUARANTEE, OR ASSUME RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY THIRD PARTY APPLICATION OR SERVICE THAT PROVIDES ACCESS TO OUR SERVICE (E.G., ANY THIRD PARTY APPLICATION DEVELOPED USING BODY’S API).</p>

		<p class="mb8">The Service is controlled, operated and hosted from within the U.S. We make no representations that the Service is appropriate or available for use in other locations. Those who access or use the Service from other jurisdictions do so at their own risk and are responsible for compliance with all applicable United States and local laws and regulations, including but not limited to export and import regulations.</p>

		<h3 class="mt16 mb16">Limitation of Liability</h3>

		<p class="mb8">TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL BODY, ITS AFFILIATES, AGENTS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES OR SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL, DATA OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES THAT RESULT FROM THE USE OF, OR INABILITY TO USE, THE SERVICE, WHETHER OR NOT BODY HAS BEEN WARNED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND EVEN IF A REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. BODY’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS RELATED TO THE SERVICE SHALL NOT EXCEED THE GREATER OF $100 OR THE AMOUNTS PAID BY YOU TO BODY IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE DURING THE TWELVE (12) MONTH PERIOD PRIOR TO THE CLAIM GIVING RISE TO SUCH LIABILITY.</p>

		<h3 class="mt16 mb16">Dispute Resolution</h3>

		<p class="mb8">*Informal Efforts - *You agree that prior to filing any claim against BODY relating to or arising out of these Terms you will first contact us at support@getbodyapp.com to provide us with an effort to resolve the issue in an informal manner.</p>

		<p class="mb8">Arbitration - If such dispute is not resolved to our mutual satisfaction within 30 days of submission, then either party may bring a formal claim, which claim shall be resolved through final and binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”).</p>

		<p class="mb8">*Arbitration Procedures and Fees- *The AAA will administer arbitration proceedings under its Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes. Arbitration will be held in the United States county where you live or work, in San Francisco, CA, or in any other location we agree to. The AAA rules will govern payment of all arbitration fees. BODY will pay all arbitration fees for claims less than $75,000. If you receive an arbitration award that is more favorable than any offer we make to resolve the claim, we will pay you $1,000 in addition to the award. BODY will not seek its attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines that your claim is frivolous.</p>

		<p class="mb8">Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate - Either you or BODY may assert a claim, if it qualifies, in small claims court in San Francisco, CA or any United States county where you live or work. Nothing in this Section shall be deemed as preventing either party from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts as necessary to stop unauthorized use or abuse of the Service or intellectual property infringement (for example, trademark, trade secrets, copyright or patent rights) without first engaging in arbitration or the informal dispute resolution process.</p>

		<p class="mb8">No Class Actions - ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, CONSOLIDATED, OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. CLASS ARBITRATIONS, CLASS ACTIONS, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTIONS, AND CONSOLIDATION WITH OTHER ARBITRATIONS ARE NOT ALLOWED.</p>

		<p class="mb8">Judicial Forum - In the event that the agreement to arbitrate is found not to apply to your claim, then you and BODY agree that any judicial proceedings will be brought in the federal or state courts in San Francisco, CA and both parties consent to venue and personal jurisdiction there.</p>

		<h3 class="mt16 mb16">Governing Law</h3>

		<p class="mb8">These Terms will be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to its conflict of laws principles. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.</p>

		<h3 class="mt16 mb16">Data Transfer</h3>

		<p class="mb8">In connection with providing you the Service BODY may transfer, store and process your Content in the U.S. or in any other country in which BODY or its agents maintain facilities. By using the Service you consent to this transfer, processing and storage of your Content.</p>

		<h3 class="mt16 mb16">Entire Agreement; Severability; Waiver</h3>

		<p class="mb8">These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and BODY concerning the Service replace any prior or contemporaneous agreements, terms or conditions applicable to your use of the Service. If a provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable, the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect and an enforceable term will be substituted reflecting as closely as possible our original intent. BODY’s failure to enforce any provision of these Terms shall not be deemed a waiver of its right to do so later.</p>

		<h3 class="mt16 mb16">Assignment</h3>

		<p class="mb8">These Terms and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by us without restriction. Any attempted transfer or assignment by you will be null and void.</p>

		<h3 class="mt16 mb16">Notices</h3>

		<p class="mb8">We may provide you with legal notices and notices related to your account via email using the email address associated with your account. We may provide you with other marketing or business-related information, including information about Service updates or changes, via email or via our blog, which is located at the URL blog.BODY.com.</p>

		<h3 class="mt16 mb16">U.S. Government Agencies</h3>

		<p class="mb8">If you are a U.S. Government agency utilizing BODY’s free Service in an official capacity, your use of the Service shall be subject to these Terms and this Amendment.</p>
