		<h5>LAST UPDATED: February 2, 2016</h5>

		<p>This Premium Membership Agreement (the “Membership Agreement”) is between BODY App, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“BODY”) and the individual agreeing to these terms (“Customer”). This Membership Agreement governs Customer’s access to BODY’s fitness service (the “Service”) and its associated applications and website. By clicking “I Agree,” attaching this Membership Agreement to a purchase order or similar order form, or using the Service as a paid Membership, Customer agrees to the terms of this Membership Agreement. If an individual is entering into this Membership Agreement on behalf of an organization, such individual shall be deemed the Customer hereunder and such individual hereby represents and warrants that he has the power and authority required to bind such Organization to this Membership Agreement.</p>

				<p><strong>The Service and Associated Software.</strong> Customer and users of the Service under Customer’s account (the “End Users”) may access and use the Services in accordance with this Membership Agreement and BODY’s <a href="/acceptable_use">Acceptable Use Policy</a>. BODY may update or modify the Services from time to time. If, in BODY’s reasonable judgment, any such modification to the Service materially reduces the Service’s functionality, BODY will inform Customer via the email address associated with Customer’s account no less than ten (10) days prior to such change. We provide certain hosted software applications (the “Software”) for use in connection with the Service. This Software is updated automatically and, if such Software is designed for use on a mobile device, then a compatible mobile device is required for use. The license being granted to Customer hereunder does not constitute a sale of the Software or any copy thereof, and as between BODY and Customer, BODY retains all right, title, and interest in the Software.</p>

				<p>BODY will use industry standard technical and individualal security measures in connection with the storage, processing and transfer of Customer Data that are designed to protect the integrity of Customer Data and to guard against the unauthorized or unlawful access to, use of or processing of such Customer Data. For purposes hereof, the term “Customer Data” shall mean the structured data and any files or attachments submitted to the Service by Customer, as well as the account and contact information submitted to the Service by Customer and its End Users.</p>

				<p>BODY will use reasonable efforts, consistent with standard industry practices, to ensure that the Service and Software do not contain any viruses, backdoors, Trojans, or other computer code that is designed to disrupt, disable or harm the operation of the Service or Software.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p><strong>Customer Obligations</strong></p>

				<p><strong>End User Conduct; Compliance.</strong> Customer is responsible for compliance with BODY’s <a href="/acceptable_use">Acceptable Use Policy</a>. The Service is not authorized for use by persons under the age of 18 and Customer ensures that they are above the age of 18.

				<p><strong>Restrictions.</strong> Customer will not: (i) rent, sell, resell or lease the Service to any third party; (ii) use the Service for any purpose where either the use or the failure of the Service might lead to personal injury, death or physical damage; or (ii) disassemble, decompile or reverse engineer the Service or attempt or assist anyone else to do so, unless such restriction is prohibited by law.</p>

In the event that this Membership Agreement is terminated, (i) the rights granted to Customer pursuant to this Membership Agreement (except as specifically set forth in this section) will cease immediately; and (ii) any premium features provided to Customer will cease to be provided. The following sections will survive expiration or termination of this Membership Agreement: Sections 4(b) and (c), 6-9, and 11.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p><strong>Indemnification.</strong></p>

				<p><strong>By Customer.</strong> Customer hereby agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless BODY, its licensees and licensors, and their respective employees, contractors, agents, officers and directors (together, the “BODY Affiliates”), from and against any and all liabilities, damages, obligations, losses, costs and expenses (including but not limited to reasonable attorney’s fees) (together, the “Losses”) arising from or as a result of any claim by a third party against BODY or the BODY Affiliates regarding: (i) use of or access to the Service by Customer or its End Users in violation of this Membership Agreement or our <a href="/acceptable_use">Acceptable Use Policy</a>; or (ii) any data or Customer Content transmitted or received through Customer’s account.</p>

				<p><strong>By BODY.</strong> BODY hereby agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Customer and its employees, contractors, agents, officers and directors (together the “Customer Affiliates”), from and against any and all Losses arising from or as a result of any claim by a third party against Customer or the Customer Affiliates to the extent based on an allegation that the Service or BODY’s technology used to provide the Service infringes or misappropriates any copyright, trade secret, U.S. patent, or trademark right of the third party. In no event will BODY have any obligations or liability under this section arising from: (i) use of the Service in a modified form or in combination with materials not furnished by BODY; (ii) use of any third party app developed using BODY’s API; or (iii) any content, information, or data provided by Customer, End Users, or other third parties. THIS INDEMNITY IS CUSTOMER’S ONLY REMEDY UNDER THIS Membership AGREEMENT FOR ANY VIOLATION BY BODY OF ANY THIRD PARTY’S INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.</p>

				<p><strong>Infringement Claims.</strong> If the Service becomes, or in BODY’s reasonable judgment is likely to become, the subject of a claim of infringement, then BODY may: (i) obtain the right, at BODY’s expense, for Customer to continue using the Service; (ii) provide a non-infringing functionally equivalent replacement; (iii) modify the Service so that it is no longer infringing. If BODY, in its sole and reasonable judgment, determines that none of the above options are commercially reasonable, then BODY may suspend or terminate Customer’s use of the Service and provide Customer with a pro rata refund of prepaid fees.</p>

				<p><strong>Process.</strong> The party seeking indemnification will provide prompt notice concerning the existence of an indemnifiable claim and cooperate fully with the indemnifying party in defending the claim. Failure to give prompt notice shall not constitute a waiver of a party’s right to indemnification and shall affect the indemnifying party’s obligations hereunder only to the extent that the indemnifying party’s rights are materially prejudiced by such failure or delay. The indemnifying party will have full control and authority over the defense of any claim; provided, however, that: (i) the indemnified party may join in the defense at its own expense using counsel of its choice; and (ii) any settlement requiring the party seeking indemnification to admit liability or make any financial payment will require such party’s prior written consent, not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed.</p>
			</li>

			<li>
				<p><strong>Limitation of Liability.</strong> TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, EXCEPT IN CONNECTION WITH THEIR RESPECTIVE INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS HEREUNDER, IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY OR THEIR RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES, AGENTS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES OR SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE UNDER THIS Membership AGREEMENT FOR (I) ANY INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES; OR (II) LOSS OF USE, DATA, BUSINESS REVENUES, PROFITS (IN EACH CASE WHETHER DIRECT OR INDIRECT), GOODWILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL BODY BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE, LOSS OR INJURY RESULTING FROM HACKING, TAMPERING OR OTHER UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS OR USE OF THE SERVICE OR CUSTOMER’S ACCOUNT OR THE INFORMATION CONTAINED THEREIN BY ANY THIRD PARTY. THESE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY SHALL APPLY REGARDLESS OF WHETHER A PARTY KNEW OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT SUCH DAMAGES WERE POSSIBLE AND EVEN IF A REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.</p>

				<p>EXCEPT IN CONNECTION WITH ITS INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS HEREUNDER, IN NO EVENT SHALL BODY BE LIABLE TO CUSTOMER FOR ANY CLAIMS, PROCEEDINGS, LIABILITIES, OBLIGATIONS, DAMAGES, LOSSES OR COSTS IN AN AMOUNT EXCEEDING THE AMOUNT PAID BY CUSTOMER TO BODY HEREUNDER DURING THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRIOR TO THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO LIABILITY.</p>
