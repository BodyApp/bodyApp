                        Yes, but the image is very small in the corner of the screen. We show everyone in class as we have found that it increases the level of motivation and engagement experienced during class. It's also allows for an opportunity for you to connect with your fellow classmates, the same way you would in an in-person class.

                        The BODY Program is tiered into multiple levels. Each level providing additional challenges. Our BODY1 class focuses on technique, comfortability with weighted movement, and the establishment of a strong baseline fitness level. These classes are great for the 2x/week trainee or newcomers looking to ramp up their fitness level and fitness education. Being surrounded with peers of similar ability levels in a slower paced environment, allows for a comfortable learning experience, with more focused individual attention and guidance to help build a strong foundation during the early stages of your fitness journey.

                      Highlights: Static core strength, fat loss, cardiovascular capacity
                      After 60 days you can expect: Increased muscle tone and body control
                    </p>
                    <h5>BODY2</h5>
                    <p>
                        Our BODY2 class builds upon the foundations established during BODY1 by adding more complex movements and weight to our routine. You’ll push yourself and sweat it out with like-minded individuals, as you compete with yourself (and others, if you choose) for rounds, time, points, glory, emotional satisfaction and physical and mental growth. You will reach new physical and emotional levels you didn’t think were possible. These classes are ideal for those who have been a member for 2+ months or have had prior athletic experience.

During the BODYX classes, there will not be as much hand holding and time will be spent on furthering skills. Trainees should have 4-6 months of experience with our program or previous experience from other functional training programs.
